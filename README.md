# 🔑 Last Lock Team 1 - Locked-In

A service optimized for room identification and processing, providing efficient data handling and API integration, automating geospatial data with AI.
---

## 📝 About

The **Locked-In Backend** serves as the core for processing and identifying room data efficiently. This project is aimed at creating a scalable and reliable backend architecture for handling room-related data.

## 🌟 Goals & Objectives

This project aims to use AI models like Claude 3 Sonnet and GPT-4o to convert SVG and raster images into GeoJSON spatial data via drag-and-drop functionality. This is then further expanded into a frontend utilizing React and Mapbox components. The frontend application should display real-time data on maps, using simulated device inputs to create heat-maps and time-series visualizations, allowing users to explore data over time. The focus is on creating a seamless, efficient interface for automating spatial data conversion while ensuring accurate, detailed mapping.

## Why this Project?

AI models are increasingly powerful and are the future. This project takes advantage of AI to automate a process that is increasingly critical across various industries. Geospatial data and map-based visualizations are growing in popularity across applications like Uber, Zillow, SnapMaps, etc. This project emphasizes the use of AI to automate time-consuming tasks while demonstrating the significance of geospatial data.
